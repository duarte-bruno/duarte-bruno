### Hello, i'm Bruno ðŸ‘‹

I'm from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, SÃ£o Paulo - SP.

I've been working on the iOS platform for more than **six years** now **using Swift and Objective-C**, but I also have more than **seven years** developing web applications and APIs **using Ruby on Rails, Angular, and NodeJs**. I have worked on applications of every size, from startups to international brands. I also have a lot of experience working with layouts and components since I started my professional career as a designer.

I'm currently working for BTG Pactual (largest investment bank in Latin America) developing their new iOS banking experience.
