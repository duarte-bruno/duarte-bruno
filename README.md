### Hello, i'm Bruno ðŸ‘‹

I'm from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, SÃ£o Paulo - SP.

I've been working on the iOS platform for 6+ years now using Swift and Objective-C, but I also have 7+ years developing web applications and APIs using Ruby on Rails, Angular, and NodeJs. I have worked on applications of every size, from startups to international brands. I also have a lot of experience working with layouts and components.

I'm currently working for BTG Pactual (largest investment bank in Latin America) developing their new iOS banking experience.
