### Hello, i'm Bruno 👋

I'm from Brazil 🇧🇷, Jundiaí - SP.

I've been working as a developer for almost 10 years on the iOS platform using Swift and Objective-C, but I've also worked as a web developer using Ruby on Rails. I've worked in companies of all sizes, from startups to multinationals. Currently, I seek to evolve even more as a professional with opportunities that challenge me.
