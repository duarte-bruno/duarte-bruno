### Hello, i'm Bruno ğŸ‘‹

I'm from Brazil ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·, JundiaÃ­ - SP.

I've been working as a developer for over 10 years on the iOS platform using Swift and Objective-C, but I've also worked as a web developer using Ruby on Rails. I've worked in companies of all sizes, from startups to multinationals. Currently, I seek to evolve even more as a professional with opportunities that challenge me.
